Kudos System Specification
1. Functional Requirements
User Stories
As a user, I can select another user from a searchable dropdown list so that I can specify who I am praising.

As a user, I can write a message of appreciation (max 500 characters) to keep the feedback concise and meaningful.

As a user, I can submit the kudos to have it stored in the database and shared with the team.

As a user, I can view a feed of recent kudos on the dashboard to see company-wide recognition.

As an administrator, I can hide or delete inappropriate kudos messages to maintain a professional environment. (Added for moderation)

Acceptance Criteria
Users cannot send kudos to themselves.

The public feed only displays kudos where is_visible is true.

Kudos messages must not be empty and cannot exceed 500 characters.

Only users with the admin role can access moderation toggles.

2. Technical Design
Database Schema
Table: Users

id: UUID (Primary Key)

name: String

email: String

role: Enum ('employee', 'admin')

Table: Kudos

id: UUID (Primary Key)

sender_id: UUID (Foreign Key -> Users.id)

recipient_id: UUID (Foreign Key -> Users.id)

message: Text (Max 500 chars)

created_at: Timestamp

is_visible: Boolean (Default: true) — Used to hide/show in feed.

moderated_by: UUID (Foreign Key -> Users.id, Nullable)

moderated_at: Timestamp (Nullable)

reason_for_moderation: String (Nullable)

API Endpoints
GET /api/users: Returns a list of all colleagues for the dropdown.

GET /api/kudos: Returns a list of visible kudos for the public feed.

POST /api/kudos: Creates a new kudos entry (Validates sender != recipient).

PATCH /api/admin/kudos/:id: Allows an admin to update is_visible and moderation notes.

Frontend Components
KudosForm: A form containing the user selection dropdown and message textarea.

KudosFeed: A list component that fetches and displays recent recognition.

ModerationToggle: A button visible only to admins on each feed item to flip the is_visible status.

3. Implementation Plan
Database Setup: Initialize the schema with the is_visible and moderation metadata fields.

API Development: Build the endpoints for fetching users and submitting kudos.

Feed Implementation: Create the dashboard feed with a filter to exclude hidden kudos.

Admin Features: Implement the logic for administrators to flag and hide specific messages.

Validation & Security: Add server-side checks for message length and user roles.
