Kudos System Specification

1. Functional Requirements

User Stories

Send Kudos: As a user, I can select a colleague from a list and write a message of appreciation (max 500 characters).

Public Feed: As a user, I can view a feed of all recent kudos on the main dashboard.

Admin Moderation: As an administrator, I can hide inappropriate kudos messages. This was added by the Architect to ensure a safe environment.

Input Validation: Users cannot submit empty messages or skip selecting a recipient.

Acceptance Criteria

Messages have a 500-character limit.

The feed shows sender, recipient, and the message content.

Admins see "Hide" buttons; standard users do not.
